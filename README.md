A BattleSnake creation by github.com/Kristian-D and github.com/Ross-Alexandra

# Running the server
In order to run the server you need to add the root of this project to your GOPATH
environmental variables. ex, If you have cloned the repo at `~/repos/battlesnake-2020`
then you would add `~/repos/battlesnake-2020` to your GOPATH.

The server can then needs to be build. This can be done with
```
go build ./src/battlesnake.theserverproject.com/start
```
